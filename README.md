# Travel-Pack-Planner

Travel-Pack-Planner is a simple React-based application that helps users manage their travel packing lists. You can add, delete, and toggle packed status of items and store the list in the browser's `localStorage` for persistence. The app also allows sorting by description, packed status, or input order and provides a clear list feature.
